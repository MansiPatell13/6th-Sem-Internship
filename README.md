## 📌 Introduction

Starting from **June 16, 2025**, I began an intensive internship at **Zidio Development**, aimed at strengthening my skills in full-stack web development.  
This program provides hands-on experience with real-world projects, tools, and team collaboration aligned with industry practices.

### The internship focuses on:
- Developing dynamic web applications using the MERN stack  
- RESTful API creation and integration  
- Component-based frontend development with React.js  
- Backend services using Node.js and Express.js  
- Working with MongoDB for data modeling and persistence  
- Utilizing tools like GitHub, Postman, Figma, and deployment platforms  
- Agile teamwork, daily updates, and task management

This README is regularly updated to reflect my day-by-day learning and progress throughout the internship.
